# Privacy Policy for xignore

*Last Updated: March 9, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the xignore Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

The xignore extension **does not collect or transmit any personal information**. The extension operates entirely on your device and all data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.

The only data stored by xignore is:
- Your list of muted words
- Your preference for hiding images (on/off)

This information is stored solely on your device using Chrome's `storage.sync` API, which may sync this data across your Chrome browsers if you are signed into Chrome.

### How We Use Information

The stored information is used exclusively to:
- Filter out tweets containing your specified muted words
- Hide images on X (formerly Twitter) if you've enabled that setting

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not:
- Collect your personal information
- Share any data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Send any data to external servers

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage mechanisms, the security of your data is managed by your browser's security protocols.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data. You can:
- Add or remove muted words at any time
- Toggle the image hiding feature on or off
- Uninstall the extension to remove all stored data

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in our GitHub repository. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in our GitHub repository or contact the developer directly.

## Consent

By using the xignore extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
